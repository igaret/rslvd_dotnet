# Technitium DNS Server Change Log

## Version 13.6
Release Date: 26 April 2025

- Added option to import a zone file when adding a Primary or Forwarder zone. This allows using a template zone file when creating new zones.
- Updated the web GUI to support custom lists for DNS Client server list, quick block drop down list and quick forwarders drop down list. To create a customized list, read the instructions given in the `www/json/readme.txt` file found in the installation folder.
- Updated the record filtering option in zone edit view to support wildcard based search.
- Fixed issue in DNS-over-QUIC service that caused the service to stop working due to failed connection handshake.
- Query Logs (Sqlite) App: Updated app to support VACCUM option to allow trimming database file on disk to reduce its size.
- Geo Continent App and Geo Country App: Updated both apps to support macro variable to simplify APP record data JSON configuration.
- Multiple other minor bug fixes and improvements.

## Version 13.5
Release Date: 6 April 2025

- Implemented [RFC 8080](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8080/) to add support for Ed25519 (15) and Ed448 (16) DNSSEC algorithms for both signing and validation.
- Added support for user specified DNSSEC private keys. This adds option to specify private key in PEM format when signing zone or when doing a key rollover.
- Added feature to filter records in the zone editor based on its name or type to allow ease of searching records in large zones.
- Added support for writing DNS logs to Console (STDOUT) along with existing option to write to a file.
- Updated Import Zone option to allow importing directly from a given file along with existing option to enter records to import with a text editor.
- Updated zone file parser to support BIND extended zone file format.
- Updated Query Logs view to show records with background color based on the type of log entry.
- Implemented [draft-fujiwara-dnsop-resolver-update](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-resolver-update/) to cache parent side NS records and child side authoritative NS records separately in DNS cache.
- Removed [NS Revalidation (draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation/) feature implementation. This featured caused increase in complexity and number of requests to name servers increasing load on the resolver. It also caused few domain names to fail to resolve when the zone's child NS records were different from parent NS records which would have otherwise resolved correctly. It did not add any benefit for the resolver operator but created operational issues. Read the discussion thread [here](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/s8KBhilK4bCrmSBRMyKaxll02lk/) to understand more about this decision.
